; [Display]
; Title              = <string>              ; Title for the main display. Will be empty if none is provided.
; Font               = path/to/FontFile      ; Specifies a default font when creating orxTEXT structures. If no value is specified, the arial font will be used by default on most systems.
; Decoration         = <bool>                ; In windowed mode, this will define if decorations (ie. window borders, buttons, …) will be used for the main display window. This property is enabled by default.
 
; FullScreen         = <bool>                ; Defines if the main display will be full screen or windowed. This property is set to false by default.
; ScreenWidth        = <int>                 ; Resolution width for the main display in pixels. Must be provided.
; ScreenHeight       = <int>                 ; Resolution height for the main display in pixels. Must be provided.
; ScreenDepth        = <int>                 ; Resolution depth for the main display in bits. Defaults to 32bit.
; Smoothing          = <bool>                ; Sets the default antialiasing mode (ie. with or without antialiasing). Defaults to false (ie. no antialiasing).
; VSync              = <bool>                ; Enables/disables the vertical synchronization. Will use system defaults if none is provided. Best results are usually achieved by enabling this property.

; [Input]
; JoystickThreshold  = <float>               ; Sets the threshold value under which joysticks' axis values are ignored. This property's default value is 0 (ie. any input, as small as it is, will be considered).
; SetList            = <list#list>           ; Provides a list of all available input sets. All these sets need to be defined in their own config section so as to be considered valid. The first valid set of this list will be selected by default as the current input set.
 
; [InputSet1]                                ; Every input action can be linked to up to 4 different physical inputs.
; <button>           = <list#list>           ; For every possible physical input, one or more actions are linked. Every time this physical input gets activated, the corresponding input actions will be triggered.

; <axis>             = <list#list>
 
; CombineList        = <list#list>           ; Provides a list of all the input actions that needs all of their physical inputs to be active before being triggered. If an action isn't listed here, every time any of its linked physical input is activated, it will be triggered.

; [Locale]
; LanguageList       = <list#list>           ; Provides the available languages for the localization module. A language will only be considered valid if a corresponding section with the same name exists. The first valid language of this list will be selected by default for the current language.

; [Mouse]
; ShowCursor         = <bool>                ; Tells if the mouse cursor should be displayed or not. This property is set to true by default.

; [Param]                                    ; Lists are not used for these properties, you need to provide the parameter value in the same way you would do it on the command line.

; [Physics]                                  ; Box2D is ORX's default physics plugin.
; AllowSleep         = <bool>                ; Defines if objects are allowed to go into sleep mode in the physics simulation when not stimulated by anything. This improves performances in the physics simulation and should be set to true unless you have a good reason. Its default value is true.
; DimensionRatio     = <float>               ; Defines the ratio between orx's world (sizes are expressed in pixels) and the physics simulation world (sizes are expressed in meters). Its default value is 0.01 which means 1 pixel is represented by 0.01 meters.
; Gravity            = <vector>              ; Defines the gravity vector used in the physics simulation. Please remember that orx 2D vertical axis Y ir oriented toward the bottom of your screen (plus = down). This value has to be provided.
; IterationsPerStep  = <int>                 ; Defines the number of iterations made by the physics simulation for every step (frame). The higher this number is, the more precise and time consuming the simulation will be. Its default value is 10, don't change it unless you feel you could use a better precision or, on the contrary, a faster physics simulation.
; WorldLowerBound    = <vector>              ; Defines the lower boundary for the physics simulation world (in pixels). This value has to be provided when using physics. The Z component will be ignored with 2D plugins such as Box2D.
; WorldUpperBound    = <vector>              ; Defines the upper boundary for the physics simulation world (in pixels). This value has to be provided when using physics. The Z component will be ignored with 2D plugins such as Box2D.

; [Render]
; MinFrequency       = <float>               ; This defines the minimal frequency for the rendering clock. This means that if your game framerate drops below this frequency, your clocks will be provided a DT maxed by this frequency, resulting in a smooth slowdown of your game rather than in a jerky/laggy rendering. Uses your target framerate as value here (often 30 or 60 Hz). Its default value is 60Hz, meaning that a game that won't be able to render at least 60 fps will appear to run slower than it should.
; ShowFPS            = <bool>                ; This property tells orx to display the current FPS in the top left corner of the main display or not. Its default value is false.

; [Screenshot]
; BaseName           = <string>              ; Base name used for your screenshot. Its default value is “screenshot-”.
; Digits             = <int>                 ; Number of digits used at the end of screenshot files. Its default value is 4.
; Directory          = path/to/directory     ; Directory where to store screenshots. By default, screenshots will be stored in the current active directory.
; Extension          = <string>              ; Extension used for screenshot files. This also defines the type of encoding for the file. Available values when used with orx's default display plugin based on SFML are bmp, tga, dds, png and jpg. Its default value is tga.

; [SoundSystem]
; DimensionRatio     = <float>               ; Defines the ratio between orx's world (sizes are expressed in pixels) and the sound simulation world (sizes are expressed in meters). Its default value is 0.01 which means 1 pixel is represented by 0.01 meters.
